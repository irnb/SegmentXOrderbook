# MultiPool Finance Smart Contracts Repository

## Introduction

This repository hosts the core smart contracts for the Multipool Finance platform, a pioneering on-chain order book decentralized exchange (DEX) featuring innovative on-chain matching functionality. At Multipool, we leverage advanced data structures like segment trees to optimize gas costs, significantly enhancing transaction efficiency and on-chain user experience.

Our unique approach redefines the traditional maker-taker flow, adapting it to better suit on-chain environments. For a detailed explanation of our platform's mechanics, including our novel approach to handling gas costs and order matching, please refer to our [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.multipool.finance/).
